In my web page, I decided to write about my Grandmother life. 
Few notes:
- In the photos section I did three photo containers that hold pictures of my grandmother, each container represents a time of her life (can be iterated with an arrow-button in order to see the next one with a fade animation)
- made a like for the page with the code provided with the tutorial in the word document.
- The mail contact is working with the jsEmail system that I connected to my private email.
